            "source": "San Francisco California is home to some of the most expensive areas to live in the United States. Over the past decade, the area has experienced rapid growth in both population and economic expansion. This growth can largely be attributed to the success of tech companies that now call San Francisco home. However, a consequence of this growth is the displacement of native residents - as rents, property, and other cost of living factors increase significantly. This issue is compounded by restrictions on new housing development and presents an environment of an extreme shortage of affordable housing.",

It is now unfortunately common to see homeless individuals using various narcotics out in the open in public spaces. There are countless reports of this phenomenon, many of which can easily be found on video sharing platforms, such as YouTube. The city Health Department's latest estimate concludes that San Francisco has more drug addicts than it has students enrolled in its public high schools. It estimates the injection-drug-addicted population at 24,500 - approximately 8,500 more people than the nearly 16,000 students enrolled in San Francisco Unified School District's 15 high schools.",

While many sources of data may differ on the precise rate for various crimes in the city, they normally agree that the city ranks higher than the state and country-wide averages for numerous categories of crime. In particular, crimes involving drugs, property crimes such as vandalism and theft, and violent crimes such as assault and robbery, all occur at rates moderately and significantly higher than many other locations both within the state and within the country.",

For example, in an effort to reduce infections disease transmission among injection drug users, the city of San Francisco handed out a record 5.8 million free syringes in 2018. This was an increase by approximately 500,000 over the amount given out in 2017. In addition to the cost of purchasing the needles, and extra $1.8 million was spent last year on efforts to retrieve used needles.
